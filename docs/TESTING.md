# Testing

How blinq is tested: which layer a test belongs to, where it lives, how to run it, and the rules that keep parallel
agents from breaking each other's runs. Tools: Vitest 5 with `@nuxt/test-utils` 4.3, and Playwright 1.63. The
security properties the tests must prove are listed in [`SECURITY.md` §10](SECURITY.md#10-verification). Every stage
file names the test or command that proves each DoD item.

Owner: `devops-ci` from W0b on. `TODO(devops-ci)` marks details that are filled in as the harness is built.
`(decision)` marks a choice this document makes where the plan left it open.

## 1. Test pyramid

| Layer | Tool | Runs against | Belongs here | Does not belong here |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | Vitest `unit` (Node) | nothing: no Postgres, LiveKit, SMTP or network | Pure logic: HKDF derivations with test vectors, app envelope and BLQ1 encoding, grid math, hotkey matcher, subscription policy, permission matrix, token grants, limiter math, env parsing, zod schemas, retention math with an injected clock | Anything that needs a running service, a browser or the Nuxt runtime |
| Component | Vitest `nuxt` (happy-dom) | the Nuxt runtime, in-process | Components and composables that need auto-imports, the router, Pinia or `useState` | Logic that fits a plain module in `app/lib` |
| API | Vitest `api` | the built test server, Postgres, Mailpit, a fake LiveKit RoomService | Every HTTP rule: validation, error codes, authorization matrix, CSRF, cookies, rate limits, SSE, webhooks, DB side effects, email content | Browser behavior |
| E2E | Playwright | the test build behind the e2e Caddy, the dev LiveKit | What only browsers prove: media and E2EE between browsers, UI flows, CSP, layout, recording end to end, timing | Rules an API test already proves |
| Manual | people | real devices, a real VM | The browser matrix (§9) and Stage 9b | Anything that can be automated |

- Push logic down. When an E2E spec needs many cases, move the decision into a pure function and table-test it there.
- A bug fix starts with a failing test in the lowest layer that reproduces it.
- DoD evidence points at a file (`— evidence: tests/api/auth/login.test.ts`) or a command
  (`` — evidence: `pnpm test:e2e -- call/e2ee` ``).

## 2. Commands

| Command | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `pnpm test` | Vitest `unit` project (`pnpm test:watch` to watch, `pnpm test --coverage` for V8 coverage) |
| `pnpm exec vitest run --project nuxt` | Nuxt-environment component tests (no package script yet) |
| `sh scripts/with-lock.sh pnpm test:api` | API tests; the global setup builds the test server first |
| `sh scripts/with-lock.sh pnpm build:test` | the test build (`BLINQ_TEST_HOOKS=1`) that E2E runs against |
| `sh scripts/with-lock.sh pnpm test:e2e` | Playwright, all projects (needs the setup in §6.2) |
| `pnpm test:e2e --project=firefox call/e2ee` | one project, spec paths matching `call/e2ee`; add `--debug` for a headed, stepping run |
| `pnpm exec playwright show-report` | the last HTML report; `pnpm exec playwright show-trace <zip>` opens a failure trace |
| `pnpm exec playwright install chromium firefox webkit` | once per machine (the nightly Edge job also installs `msedge`) |
| `pnpm check:english` | fails on any Cyrillic character in tracked and new files |

Arguments: pnpm 11 forwards everything after the script name, including a literal `--`.
- Vitest drops every argument after `--`, so `pnpm test -- grid` silently runs the whole project. Write `pnpm test grid`.
- Playwright reads arguments after `--` as file filters, so the evidence form `pnpm test:e2e -- call/e2ee` works.

## 3. Where tests live

```
app/lib/**, app/composables/**, shared/**      <name>.test.ts next to the code             unit
server/services/**, server/utils/**            <name>.test.ts next to the code             unit
server/database/**, scripts/**                 <name>.test.ts (schema and script helpers)  unit
app/**                                         <Name>.nuxt.test.ts                         nuxt
tests/api/<domain>/*.test.ts                   e.g. tests/api/auth/login.test.ts           API
tests/api/_harness/                            global setup, client, factories, Mailpit, webhook signer
tests/e2e/<area>/*.spec.ts                     e.g. tests/e2e/call/e2ee.spec.ts            E2E
tests/e2e/fixtures/                            Playwright fixtures, combined with mergeTests
tests/fixtures/media/                          reference and malicious media files
```

- **Never** put a test file under `server/api`, `server/routes`, `server/middleware`, `server/plugins` or
  `server/tasks`. Nitro scans them and would register the file as a route, middleware, plugin or task.
- `*.nuxt.test.ts` runs only in the `nuxt` project. A plain `*.test.ts` never needs the Nuxt runtime.
- Time and randomness are injected (`Clock` from `server/contracts/index.ts`, `now()` parameters). Fakes implement the
  interfaces in `server/contracts/**` and `app/lib/contracts/**` instead of mocking module paths.
- Crypto code has the fixed test vectors from `docs/API.md` plus tamper cases: a flipped bit, truncation, a wrong AAD.
- Non-ASCII test data (Cyrillic layouts, bidi characters) is written as `\u` escapes or built with
  `String.fromCodePoint`, never as literal characters.

## 4. Vitest projects (`vitest.config.ts`)

| Project | Includes | Environment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `unit` | `**/*.test.ts` in `app/lib`, `app/composables`, `shared`, `server/services`, `server/utils`, `server/database`, `scripts` | `node` | Aliases `~`, `@`, `~~` and `#shared` resolve as in Nuxt; runs with the dev stack stopped |
| `nuxt` | `app/**/*.nuxt.test.ts` | `nuxt` (happy-dom) | `mountSuspended`, `mockNuxtImport`, `registerEndpoint` from `@nuxt/test-utils/runtime`; slow to start, keep them few |
| `api` | `tests/api/**/*.test.ts` | `node` | `globalSetup: tests/api/_harness/global-setup.ts`; test timeout 30 s, hook timeout 240 s (covers the build) |

`node_modules`, `.claude`, `.nuxt` and `.output` are excluded everywhere, so worktrees never leak tests into each other.

## 5. API tests

### 5.1 Harness (`tests/api/_harness/`, owner `server-core`)

`global-setup.ts` runs once per `pnpm test:api`:
1. Builds the test server (`pnpm build:test`, under the lock).
2. Recreates a dedicated database, the worktree's database name plus `_test_api` (`blinq` → `blinq_test_api`, the
   Stage 01 name that CI uses; `blinq_auth` → `blinq_auth_test_api`) (decision), and migrates it with the bundled CLI
   (`.output/server/cli.mjs migrate`).
3. Starts `.output/server/index.mjs` on a free port with an explicit environment (the built server does not read
   `.env`): that database, `LIVEKIT_URL=fake://local`, SMTP pointing at Mailpit, `PUBLIC_URL` set to its own origin.
4. Hands the base URL to test files with `provide('apiBaseUrl')` (`inject('apiBaseUrl')` in tests); stops on teardown.

All files share one server, limiter store and settings cache. So API files run one at a time (single fork,
`fileParallelism: false`), and tests that change admin settings restore them in `afterEach`.

Helpers next to it (exact names: TODO(server-core)): an HTTP client with a cookie jar and `api.as(user)`; factories
(`createUser`, `createAdmin`, `createSession`, `createRoom`, `createRoomInvite`, `createMeeting`,
`createParticipant`); a Mailpit client; `signWebhook()`; `uniqueIp()`.

### 5.2 Rules

- **Unique data per test.** Emails like `u-<uuid>@example.test`, unique room names. No test depends on another test's
  data or on order, and none asserts on global counts (all users, all rooms, all emails).
- **Rate limits.** Every test sends its own `X-Forwarded-For` from `uniqueIp()`: a random /64 in `2001:db8::/32`
  (limiters key IPv6 by /64) or an address in `198.51.100.0/24` or `203.0.113.0/24`. The app trusts the header only
  because it is reachable solely from loopback behind Caddy.
- **CSRF.** Mutations send `Origin: <apiBaseUrl>`. CSRF tests send a foreign `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site`
  and expect `CSRF_REJECTED`.
- **Assertions.** Check the status and `data.code` (`shared/utils/error-codes/*`), never message text.
- **Time.** The built server's clock is never moved (Stage 01 decision). Expiry and retention tests age rows in the
  test database instead, for example by setting `expires_at` in the past. Pure time math is unit-tested with a `Clock`.

### 5.3 Email (Mailpit)

- The dev stack's Mailpit catches every message: SMTP `127.0.0.1:1025`, API `http://127.0.0.1:8025/api/v1`, UI
  `http://localhost:8025`.
- Find mail by its unique recipient (`GET /api/v1/search?query=to:"<address>"`), fetch `GET /api/v1/message/<ID>`, and
  take the token from the link fragment (`/invite#<token>`, `/verify-email#<token>`, `/reset-password#<token>`).
- Poll with a timeout (delivery is asynchronous). "No enumeration" tests assert that nothing arrived.
- Never call `DELETE /api/v1/messages`: every agent shares this Mailpit.

### 5.4 LiveKit

- **Fake (default).** `LIVEKIT_URL=fake://local` selects an in-memory `RoomServiceAdapter` (interface in
  `server/contracts/index.ts`) that records every call. `GET /api/__test/livekit-calls` returns them as
  `[{ method, args, at }]` in test builds only (proposed in [`API.md` §11](API.md#11-test-only-none-in-production),
  pending orchestrator approval). Authorization-matrix and host-action tests assert on the calls for their own room:
  `removeParticipant`, `updateParticipant` with the complete permission object, and `updateRoomMetadata` only through
  `publishRoomState`.
- **Real (a few tests).** Files named `*.livekit.test.ts` run only when `API_LIVEKIT_URL` is set, and the harness then
  starts the server against it (dev: `http://127.0.0.1:7880`) (decision). They cover what the fake cannot: room
  create/list/delete with `auto_create: false`, the metadata round trip, errors for missing rooms and participants.
  CI runs them as a small separate job.
- The dev LiveKit is shared: use unique room names, delete your rooms in teardown, never touch rooms you did not create.

### 5.5 Webhooks

LiveKit posts `Content-Type: application/webhook+json` with an `Authorization` JWT whose `sha256` claim is the base64
SHA-256 of the raw body. Tests sign the same way, so the app's `WebhookReceiver.receive(body, authHeader)` accepts them:

```ts
import { createHash } from 'node:crypto'
import { AccessToken } from 'livekit-server-sdk'

export async function signWebhook(body: string, apiKey: string, apiSecret: string): Promise<string> {
  const token = new AccessToken(apiKey, apiSecret)
  token.sha256 = createHash('sha256').update(body).digest('base64')
  return token.toJwt()
}
```

Build bodies in LiveKit's JSON shape with `new WebhookEvent({ event: 'participant_joined', id, room: { name } })
.toJsonString()` (`WebhookEvent` from `livekit-server-sdk`). Signature tests also send a wrong secret, a modified body
and a replayed event id (must be deduplicated).

## 6. E2E tests (Playwright)

### 6.1 What E2E runs against

```
Playwright ─► e2e Caddy (E2E_BASE_URL, default http://localhost:8080; docker/e2e/Caddyfile)
                ├─ /rtc*            ─► dev LiveKit :7880 (signaling)
                ├─ /api/webhooks/*  ─► 404 (LiveKit calls the app directly)
                └─ everything else  ─► the test build on your PORT (node .output/server/index.mjs)
Browsers ══ media: LAN IP from scripts/detect-ip.sh, UDP 7882 / TCP 7881 ══► dev LiveKit
dev LiveKit ─ webhooks ─► http://host.docker.internal:<PORT>/api/webhooks/livekit (PORT 3000–3005)
```

On native Linux (CI) `host.docker.internal` does not reach the host's loopback interface, so `docker/e2e/compose.yml`
adds a small forwarder service (`docker/e2e/host-gateway.Caddyfile`) that relays traffic from the Docker network to the
app on the host. It also makes LiveKit webhooks reach the app in CI.

- The test build (`pnpm build:test`) is the production build plus the harness page `/dev/call` and
  `window.__blinqTest` (and `GET /api/__test/livekit-calls` if approved, which only API tests use).
- App and signaling are same-origin, so the production CSP (`connect-src 'self'`) applies unchanged. The CSP additions
  for `localhost:7880` exist only in `nuxt dev`.
- The app runs with `PUBLIC_URL` = `E2E_BASE_URL` and `LIVEKIT_PUBLIC_URL` = the same origin with `ws://`, so links,
  cookies and CSRF checks use the Caddy origin.
- LiveKit advertises the LAN IP because Firefox rejects loopback ICE candidates. E2E runs with 1 worker; every test
  creates its own rooms.
- All E2E traffic reaches the app from one IP (the Caddy container), so per-IP limits are a shared budget across a
  whole run: for example `auth-ip` allows 10 attempts per minute. Keep failing-login specs few, or give them distinct
  accounts and wait out windows instead of relying on retries.

### 6.2 Running locally

1. The shared dev stack is up (`pnpm dev:deps`, run by the orchestrator) and your worktree is set up (§7).
2. Stop your `pnpm dev` server (the E2E server uses your port), then run:
   `sh scripts/e2e.sh --project=chromium tests/e2e/<area>`
   The script holds the machine-wide lock (`scripts/with-lock.sh`), builds the test build (`pnpm build:test`),
   recreates and migrates the `blinq_e2e` database, starts `.output/server/index.mjs` with the E2E environment (§6.1),
   starts the e2e Caddy (`docker/e2e/compose.yml`, project `blinq-e2e`), waits for health, runs Playwright with your
   arguments, and stops everything on exit.
   Variables: `E2E_SKIP_BUILD=1` reuses the last test build; `E2E_APP_PORT` overrides the app port;
   `E2E_DB_NAME` overrides the database name.

Artifacts: `test-results/` (trace, video and screenshot kept on failure), `playwright-report/`, and the logs in
`logs/e2e/{app,caddy}.log` (`E2E_LOG_DIR` overrides the directory).

### 6.3 Projects and fake media (`playwright.config.ts`)

| Project | Engine | Media setup | Runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chromium` | Desktop Chrome | flags `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream`, `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream`, `--auto-select-desktop-capture-source=Entire screen`, `--auto-accept-this-tab-capture`, `--autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required` | all specs |
| `firefox` | Desktop Firefox | prefs `media.navigator.streams.fake` and `media.navigator.permission.disabled` = true, `permissions.default.camera` and `permissions.default.microphone` = 1, `media.autoplay.default` = 0 | all specs |
| `webkit-ui` | Desktop Safari (WebKit) | mock capture devices through `context.grantPermissions(['camera', 'microphone'])` (Playwright ≥ 1.62) | `@ui` specs |
| `mobile-chromium` | Pixel 7 emulation | the Chromium flags | `@responsive` specs |

- Linux WebKit has no `RTCRtpScriptTransform`, so it cannot do E2EE. There the call page must show the
  unsupported-browser screen and never connect (a useful `@ui` check). E2EE on WebKit runs only in the non-blocking
  macOS WebKit nightly job.
- Fake devices produce moving video and a tone. Specs assert decoded frames and non-silent audio, never pixel content.
- Screen share uses the `useFakeScreenSource` hook (a 1920×1080 canvas), not the desktop picker, so it is deterministic.
- For a Chromium ↔ Firefox call in one test, `joinAs` launches the other browser with the same flags or prefs.
- Nightly adds Edge (`channel: 'msedge'`) and macOS WebKit: TODO(devops-ci).
- Tags, set with the `tag` option (`test('login renders', { tag: '@ui' }, async ({ page }) => { … })`): `@ui` (no media
  or E2EE; also runs in `webkit-ui`), `@responsive` (also runs in `mobile-chromium`), `@nightly` (nightly.yml only; PR
  runs pass `--grep-invert @nightly`) (decision).

### 6.4 Fixtures (`tests/e2e/fixtures/`)

Specs import `test` and `expect` from `tests/e2e/fixtures/index.ts`. It exports
`test = mergeTests(base, livekit, media, recording)` (each file exports its own `test.extend(...)`) and re-exports
`expect`.

| File | Owner | Provides |
|---|---|---|
| `base.ts` | `devops-ci` | the global guards (§6.5), `secrets.track(value)`, the per-test `allowConsoleErrors` option |
| `livekit.ts` | `call-core` | `joinAs(role, options)` |
| `media.ts` | `media-fx` | processor helpers (blur, noise suppression) |
| `recording.ts` | `recording-client` | ffprobe/volumedetect helpers, forced MIME, chunk-failure injection |
| `join.ts` | `rooms-backend` | DB-backed join through the real join API (creates `call_participants` rows) |

Call-core's fake-device helpers, first-frame waits and `getStats` polling live in `livekit.ts`. W0a commits
`livekit.ts`, `media.ts` and `recording.ts` as stubs, so `index.ts` (frozen after W0b) does not change when `call-core`
implements them (decision). Other areas add fixture files through a report request.

**`joinAs(role, options)`**: `role` is `host`, `cohost` or `participant`; options are `name`, `kind` (`user` or
`guest`), `room` (reuse a room from an earlier `joinAs` in the same test), `browser`, and `e2ee` (`off` only for the
unencrypted-publisher negative test).
- Creates the LiveKit room with `RoomServiceClient.createRoom` under a unique name (the server runs with
  `auto_create: false`) and deletes it on teardown.
- Mints the token with `livekit-server-sdk` from the grants table in `docs/API.md`. Once `rooms-backend` merges, it
  switches to `buildParticipantToken` (`server/services/livekit/token.ts`), so grants and attributes (`role`, `kind`,
  `hand`, `vol`) match production exactly.
- Generates `K` and the epoch, then opens `/dev/call#url=…&token=…&k=…&epoch=…&slug=…&name=…&e2ee=…` in a new browser
  context. It registers the key and token with `secrets.track` and returns the page, identity, room name, key and epoch.

### 6.5 Global guards (every test)

`base.ts` auto-fixtures fail the test when:
- a `securitypolicyviolation` event fires in any page (an init script records directive, blocked URI and source);
- a console message of type `error` or an uncaught page error appears, unless it matches the test's narrow
  `allowConsoleErrors` list (for example a deliberate 403 in a negative test);
- a secret appears in the app log or the e2e Caddy log: any tracked value (room key, join proof, LiveKit token,
  invite/session/guest token, password) or a generic pattern (JWT-shaped `eyJ…`, `#k=`). Logs: `logs/e2e/app.log` and
  `logs/e2e/caddy.log`.

Fixture API (`base.ts`): `guards.watch(context)` for extra browser contexts, `guards.allowConsoleError(pattern)`,
`secrets.track(value)` (values of at least 8 characters) and `secrets.expectNoLeaks()`. Secrets from the test
environment are tracked automatically, and a final log scan runs once per worker.

`rooms/key-leak.spec.ts` (Stage 04) goes further. It records every request URL and body, WebSocket frame and SSE URL,
then searches them, a `pg_dump` of the test database and both logs for `K` and everything derived from it.

### 6.6 Test hooks (`window.__blinqTest`)

Contract: `app/lib/contracts/test-hooks.ts`. The hooks exist only in dev and `pnpm build:test` output, because
`__BLINQ_TEST_HOOKS__` is a compile-time constant. Harness pages live in `app/dev/*`, registered only in dev and test
builds. ci.yml proves the production build has no `__blinqTest` and that `/dev/call` returns 404.

| Hook | Used for |
|---|---|
| `metrics` | join timing: `performance.mark` timestamps for click, connected and first remote frame |
| `useFakeScreenSource(enabled)` | screen share with a synthetic 1920×1080 canvas instead of `getDisplayMedia` |
| `publishUnencryptedTrack()` | `call/unencrypted-blocked`, from a harness client joined with `e2ee=off`: peers must never subscribe to its track |
| `forceRecordingMime(mime)` | recording format specs |
| `state` | feature snapshots: `state.subscriptions` (policy output incl. requested sizes), `state.inboundVideo` (`getStats` frame size and `framesDecoded` per remote track) |

### 6.7 Timing policy

Join time runs from `blinq:join:click` to `blinq:join:first-remote-frame` (detected with `requestVideoFrameCallback`),
with the remote peer already publishing. Specs: `call/join-time` (harness) and `rooms/guest-invite-join` (real flow).

| Where | Samples | Assertion |
|---|---|---|
| Local | 1 | none: the value is printed and attached to the report |
| PR gate (e2e.yml, `CI` set) | 1 | < 6 s |
| Nightly (`E2E_NIGHTLY=1`) | 1 discarded warm-up, then 10 warm joins (same browser, page reloaded, same live room) | p95 < 3 s by nearest rank, which for 10 samples is the slowest join (decision) |

Other latency limits in stage DoDs are asserted as written, everywhere: lobby admit → SSE < 1 s, host action → peer
≤ 1 s, REC indicator ≤ 1 s. If one flakes, fix the cause or measure at a lower layer; never raise a limit quietly.

### 6.8 Recording tests (Stage 08)

- **Format.** `forceRecordingMime` selects WebM (VP9/Opus) or MP4 (H.264/AAC). A type the browser cannot record
  (`MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported` false, for example MP4 in Firefox) is skipped with an annotation, never passed.
- **Flow.** A host with an account records a two-person call for about 10 s, stops, polls until the recording is
  `ready`, and downloads the server's MP4.
- **File checks.** ffmpeg and ffprobe come from `PATH` (local ffmpeg 9; in CI copied from `mwader/static-ffmpeg:9.0.2`):
  - `ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration:stream=codec_type,codec_name -of json out.mp4`: duration about
    10 s (tolerance set in Stage 08), exactly one `h264` video stream and one `aac` audio stream;
  - `ffmpeg -hide_banner -nostats -i out.mp4 -vn -af volumedetect -f null -`: `max_volume` above the Stage 08
    threshold (digital silence reads about -91 dB), which proves the remote audio reached the mix.
- **Upload failures.** `page.route('**/api/recordings/*/chunks/*', …)` aborts selected chunk uploads; the file must
  still be complete.
- **At rest (API tests).** Stored bytes are ciphertext, tampering or truncation is an error, Range responses are exact,
  and the malicious fixtures in `tests/fixtures/media/` are rejected.
- **Nightly.** One long recording (≥ 30 min, decision) covers upload backlog, memory and the `partial` finalize path.

### 6.9 Network degradation (nightly, Stage 10)

- Playwright's offline mode and CDP `Network.emulateNetworkConditions` shape only HTTP and WebSocket traffic: use them
  for signaling drops. WebRTC media needs `tc netem`.
- On the Linux runner, impair the dev LiveKit container's interface (SFU → browser media):
  ```sh
  pid=$(docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' blinq-dev-livekit-1)
  sudo nsenter -t "$pid" -n tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem rate 1mbit delay 150ms 30ms loss 3%
  sudo nsenter -t "$pid" -n tc qdisc del dev eth0 root
  ```
- Scenario (Chromium ↔ Firefox call): 20 s baseline, 60 s impaired, then cleared, 30 s recovery. Pass: no
  `Disconnected` event; `framesDecoded` keeps rising; the received resolution drops to a lower simulcast layer while
  impaired and returns to the baseline layer within 30 s after clearing; audio stays non-silent. Stage 10 tunes the
  numbers.
- CI only (root on Linux). Never impair the shared dev stack while other agents are testing.

## 7. Parallel agents and isolation

- **Setup.** `node scripts/worktree-setup.mjs <agent> <port>` installs with the frozen lockfile, creates and migrates
  `blinq_<agent>` (dashes become underscores) on the shared Postgres at `127.0.0.1:55432`, vendors browser assets, and
  writes `PORT`, `PUBLIC_URL` and `DATABASE_URL` into the worktree's `.env`.
- **Ports.** 3000 is the orchestrator's; agents use 3001–3005. The dev LiveKit sends webhooks only to
  `host.docker.internal:3000–3005`.
- **Heavy commands** run under `sh scripts/with-lock.sh <command>`: `pnpm build`, `pnpm build:test`, `pnpm test:api`,
  `pnpm test:e2e`, image builds. The lock is the directory `/tmp/blinq-heavy.lock` (`BLINQ_LOCK_DIR` overrides it); a
  lock left by a killed process is removed automatically. One E2E run at a time, machine-wide.
- **The shared dev stack is not yours.** Never run `docker compose down`, run `up` with other settings, or remove its
  volumes. If it is down, say so in your report.
- **Shared services, private data.** Postgres: only your databases (`blinq_<agent>`, `blinq_<agent>_test_api`). Mailpit:
  search by your recipients, never clear it. LiveKit: unique room names, delete only your own. Never assert on
  server-wide counts.
- Each worktree has its own `.output/`, `test-results/` and `playwright-report/`. `.claude/**` is excluded from Vitest,
  ESLint, TypeScript and the Nuxt watcher.

## 8. CI (`.github/workflows/`, owner `devops-ci`)

| Workflow | Runs on | Jobs |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | push, PR | frozen install + `git diff --exit-code`; lint; typecheck; `unit` + `nuxt`; `check:english` over `git ls-files`; gitleaks; actionlint; `pnpm audit`; `build` + `build:test` (the prod build has no `__blinqTest`, and `/dev/call` returns 404); API tests (Postgres and Mailpit services, fake RoomService); a small real-LiveKit API job |
| `e2e.yml` | push, PR | dev compose (LiveKit `node_ip` = the runner's eth0 IP); test build; e2e Caddy; `chromium` + `firefox` (1 worker), `webkit-ui`, `mobile-chromium`; ffmpeg/ffprobe from `mwader/static-ffmpeg:9.0.2`; report, traces and logs uploaded on failure |
| `docker.yml` | push, PR (from Stage 09a) | image build with BuildKit cache; `docker compose config`; `scripts/smoke-prod.sh` (prod compose with `TLS_MODE=internal`, a Playwright container on the host network); `ss -tulpn` shows only the intended public listeners |
| `nightly.yml` | schedule | join-time p95, network degradation, long recording, Edge, macOS WebKit (non-blocking) |

Actions are pinned by commit SHA. After every merge the orchestrator runs the same gate locally
([`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) → Merge gate).

Local equivalents of the CI-only checks:
- `node scripts/check-build.mjs` — asserts the production build contains no test hooks or harness chunks (and the
  test build does).
- `sh scripts/scan-secrets.sh` — gitleaks over the repository history (`.gitleaks.toml` allowlists the public dev-only
  values in `.env.dev.example` and `docker-compose.dev.yml`).
- `sh scripts/lint-workflows.sh` — actionlint and shellcheck over `.github/workflows/`.
- `pnpm audit` is report-only in `ci.yml` and blocking in `release.yml`.

## 9. Manual cross-browser matrix `[user]`

Run before the release (Stage 10) on real devices, against a deployment installed by following the README. Replace
each cell with `pass`, `fail (#issue)` or `n/a`. "expect hidden" passes when the control is not offered.

Tested: TODO [user] (date, tester, browser and OS versions, blinq version).

How to check each row:
- **Join + E2EE:** two devices join one room; the E2EE badge is green on both and the safety codes match.
- **Camera/mic switching:** change devices during the call; the other side gets the new device without a rejoin.
- **Speaker selection:** choose another output where the picker is offered.
- **Screen share:** share a window at 1080p; text is readable on the receiver; stopping restores the layout.
- **Blur, noise suppression:** toggle in pre-join and in the call; the effect reaches the other side without a
  republish; RNNoise audibly removes fan or keyboard noise.
- **Recording:** record about 1 min in server mode and in local-only mode; both play back with audio and video, and
  everyone sees the REC indicator.
- **Hotkeys:** M (mic), V (camera), Space (push-to-talk while muted), ? (help); repeat with a Cyrillic layout active.
- **Chat:** messages reach every device; `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` shows as text.
- **Responsive layout:** portrait and landscape; the control bar stays reachable; no horizontal scrolling.

Known platform limits:
- iOS and Android browsers offer no screen capture to web pages, so blinq hides the screen-share button there.
- `supportsAudioOutputSelection()` is false on Safari (macOS, iOS) and Android: the speaker picker is hidden there.
- Safari before 17.2 publishes without simulcast under E2EE.
- A browser without E2EE support gets an explanation screen; blinq never falls back to an unencrypted call.
